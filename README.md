# About the Project
This is an SQL project for a class.  
Provided with 6 CSV files containing employee information for a fictional company "Pewlett Hackard," I created a database schema from the records.  
All initial planning was done with Quick Data Base diagrams which were then imported to PostgreSQL.  
All CSV files were imported to the database's tables.  
Further inquiries for the company were made in SQL to bring back certain information about the employees.

# Built In

PostreSQL.  

# Resources
